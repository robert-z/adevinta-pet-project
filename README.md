# Adevinta's Pet Project

This repository contains my solution to the Pet Project proposed by [Adevinta](https://www.adevinta.com/).

The project consists in creating a movie search platform using the SUI Tools from Adevinta Spain and the [themoviedb api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).  In this platform you can search the movies by title.

See deployed version [here](http://pet-project.robert-z.surge.sh/)
